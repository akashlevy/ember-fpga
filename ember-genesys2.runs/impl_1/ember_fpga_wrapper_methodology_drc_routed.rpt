2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.011 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_spi_slave_rram/u_itrx_apbm_spi/u_spi_fsm/prdata_sr_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.394 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_fsm/FSM_sequential_state_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.499 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_fsm/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.507 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_fsm/FSM_sequential_state_reg[4]_rep/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.547 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_fsm/FSM_sequential_state_reg[4]_rep__0/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.575 ns between sa_do[3] (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and ember_fpga_i/rram_top_wrapper_0/inst/inst/u_fsm/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.158 ns between ember_fpga_i/clk_wiz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0) and sa_clk (clocked by clk_out1_ember_fpga_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
